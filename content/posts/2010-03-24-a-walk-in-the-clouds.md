I&#8217;ve moved this site over to the cloud servers, by Rackspace from my previous shared host. Actually I was looking for a cloud server and cloud space so that I can play with Hadoop. I found Amazon EC servers and S3, but their services charges are expensive for me. While searching for alternatives, CloudServers caught my attention.

It is cheaper than Amazon services, but at the moment I don&#8217;t think I can test Hadoop on CloudServer and with CloudSpace. I&#8217;m using it more like a virtual private server, that gives me &#8220;root&#8221; access. The good thing is you can modify the resources as you wish, so I would say it&#8217;s quite scalable. You are also charged by hours (uptime). Rackspace will also charge you even if you turn off the machine. They will not charge after we have deleted the server. If you want to test something for a project, you can just subscribe for desired amount of memory and disk space. And delete the server after it&#8217;s been used. We will only be charged for those period. That&#8217;s the flexibility that I prefer.

I&#8217;ll see what I can do with my server, and update the blog again.
