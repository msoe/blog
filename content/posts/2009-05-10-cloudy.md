These days, something relates to software platforms that perform distributed computing on a cluster, catches my attention, and this led me to:

  * <a title="Apache Hadoop" href="http://hadoop.apache.org/" target="_blank">Hadoop</a>/<a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/hbase/" target="_blank">Hbase</a>/Pig and
  * Mapreduce/Sawzall/Bigtable

Hadoop platform is just the open-source implementation of Google&#8217;s Mapreduce.

I think the most basic ingredient for the this platform is distributed file system. Basically MapReduce framework works in two steps, it Maps and then it Reduces. At the end of the workflow it writes the output to a distributed file system (GFS for Google or HDFS for Hadoop). GFS is proprietory to Google, and it&#8217;s implemented in userspace as opposed to be in kernel. Please find Google Research Publication for GFS <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/gfs.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

Some people say that the implementation is low-level and some tried to add more layer to original implementations. For example, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=16121578919" target="_blank">Facebook </a>layered Hive on Hadoop engine.

<a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html" target="_blank">MapReduce</a> framework is supposed to handle huge amount of data, so in general we will need a data structure that can hold/process this amount of data comfortably. Google implemented <a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/bigtable.html" target="_blank">BigTable</a>, and <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/hbase/" target="_blank">HBase</a> is the open-source alternative from Hadoop.

I think I&#8217;ll look into Hadoop (Java implementation) and <a href="http://labs.trolltech.com/page/Projects/Threads/QtConcurrent" target="_blank">Qt Concurrent</a> (Qt C++ implementation) of MapReduce.

Last.fm&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.last.fm/2009/04/06/mapreduce-bash-script" target="_blank">bashreduce </a>look interesting, too.
